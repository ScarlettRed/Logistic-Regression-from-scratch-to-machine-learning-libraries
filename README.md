# Logistic-Regression-from-scratch-to-machine-learning-libraries
In this project we will learn how to implement a logistic regression model without the use of machine learning frameworks such as scikit-learn and statemodels.

## How to start
We'll start from basic loading the data into the notebook through pandas and then evaluating the data through head() and info().
